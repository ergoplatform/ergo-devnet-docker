# Ergo-node(devnet) Docker images

Here we create docker images which run the official Ergo node in `devnet` mode. The node's REST API is accessible on port 9053. These images are currently used by [sigma-rust](https://github.com/ergoplatform/sigma-rust) for integration testing.

**Current ergo node version:** v4.0.26
